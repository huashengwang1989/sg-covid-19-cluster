# sg-covid-19-cluster

A React program for Singapore's COVID-19 infection clusters data visualisation.

The app is published at: https://huashengwang1989.github.io/sg-covid-19-cluster/

The data is updated daily at `/src/data/clusters`, after MOH's press release.

While trying to be accurate and on time, the updates are not guaranteed for correctedness and timeliness. Information and data is mostly obtained from MOH. However, this personal project is purely by hobby and has no official affiliation with MOH. 

## Development

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
